READ_ME file for Figure 1.

 Fig 1 A. Pie charts describing % abundance of proteins along the GI tract. 

To generate the pie charts, run summary_stats.m. This program creates a pie chart for each of the 15 different samples (3 colonization states * 5 locations)



Fig 1 B. Venn diagrams describing protein overlap between colonization states along the GI tract

To generate the Venn diagrams, run vennFileGenerator.m. This file generates a data structure that contains all of the proteins found in each sample entitled “uniqueProtIds” (3 rows representing the 3 colonization states and 5 columns representing the 5 locations). Text files were generated from this data structure, and they are saved in the “text files generated by vennFileGenerator” folder. These text files were then fed into VennMaster (http://sysbio.uni-ulm.de/?Software:VennMaster). 

The hypergeometric_dist.m file was used to calculate the significance of the overlaps in each Venn diagram.

The mintersect.m file was taken from Matlab File Exchange. It was used inside of vennFileGenerator.m to calculate the core proteome across all locations and colonization states. The Supplemental Table 1 excel file lists these proteins in the core proteome.



Fig 1 C. Shannon diversity

To determine the Shannon diversity of each sample, run shannon_diversity.m. This file creates a bar graph that plots the Shannon-Weiner diversity index of each sample. It uses the file index_SaW.m (from Matlab File Exchange) to calculate the Shannon-Weiner indices. This file also calls barweb.m, which was taken from Matlab File Exchange, in order to plot the bar graph with error bars. 



Fig 1 D. Unique Proteins in each sample

TO calculate unique proteins in each sample, you also run shannon_diversity.m. This file creates a bar graph plotting the number of unique proteins for the 15 samples (5 locations * 3 colonization states). Again, this file calls barweb.m to poor the bar graph with error bars.
