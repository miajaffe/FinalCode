General Overview:
We divided our collection of scripts into folders, such that every folder
contained all the scripts required to generate the figure in the folder name,
e.g. all the scripts and files in the folder Figure_1 collectively generate
figure 1 for our paper. We also have an Initialization folder which contains
all the scripts and files required to generate the matrices and data files required
for the processes in each figure folder.  Thus, it is imeprative to read the Initialization
folder's README and run the appropriate files in the prescribed order.

How to use:
1) Run Initialization_Script_Final1.m and Initialization_Script_Final2.m
in Matlab, located in the Initialization folder.
2) Read the README files associated with each Figure folder to see the order
of which to run the individual scripts
3) When in doubt, use the help function to see what each script or function does
